# TODO:

  need to fix when i have watcher version(installed version) older than latest 10
* create once job download list from github release notes (also should download newly added )
* DB should save data to volume and load during app startup

* if repo not found what to do?
* queue per day (we need to get updates from repos one per day to get new releases)
* queue right now (when used added plugin he expects that it will be downloaded right now!)
* add jenkins plugin conroller (update delete add new plugin resolve deps)
* add feed (show latest updates for plugins, do UI notification? where?)
